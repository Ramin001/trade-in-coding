find the places where most contributions to open source coding is done

This repo is part of a project in which I try to map the open source contributions geographically to see which parts of the world are "importers" or "exporters" of the open source softwares.

I base this on two data sources: Github public repositories and Kaggle competitions, scraping each individual contributor's geographical information.
